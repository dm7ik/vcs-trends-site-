        <h1>Historical Timeline — Key Version Control Systems</h1>
        
        <p>1972 – SCCS: First VCS at Bell Labs. Tracked file changes; mainframe-based</p>
        <p>982 – RCS: Automated file versioning locally (no networking). Stored differences between versions (deltas)</p>
        <p>1986 – CVS: Built on RCS; enabled team collaboration via a central server. Popular but lacked atomic commits and good branching</p>
        <p>2000 – Subversion (SVN): Fixed CVS’s flaws with atomic commits and better performance, still centralized</p>
        <p>2005 – Git & Mercurial: Birth of distributed VCS (DVCS). Git (by Linus Torvalds) became dominant; Mercurial simpler but less adopted</p>
        <p>2008 – GitHub: Made Git social — added pull requests, issue tracking, and easy sharing</p>
        <p>2010s–2020s: Git became industry standard. Rise of GitOps, CI/CD integration, and AI-assisted code management</p>

        <h1>Why distributed VCS changed it all</h1>

        <p><b>Each developer has a full repo copy</b> — no reliance on a single central server</p>
		<p><b>Offline work possible</b> — commits and branching can happen without network access</p>
		<p><b>Branching & merging = easy and fast</b> — encourages experimentation and parallel work</p>
		<p><b>Resilience & redundancy</b> — every clone is a full backup</p>
        <p><b>Flexible collaboration</b> — peer-to-peer or via a central hub like GitHub</p>
        <p><i><b>Result:</b> Modern teams prefer DVCS for speed, reliability, and freedom from single points of failure</i></p>
