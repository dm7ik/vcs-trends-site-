        <h1>Why distributed VCS changed it all</h1>

        <p><b>Each developer has a full repo copy</b> — no reliance on a single central server</p>
		<p><b>Offline work possible</b> — commits and branching can happen without network access</p>
		<p><b>Branching & merging = easy and fast</b> — encourages experimentation and parallel work</p>
		<p><b>Resilience & redundancy</b> — every clone is a full backup</p>
        <p><b>Flexible collaboration</b> — peer-to-peer or via a central hub like GitHub</p>
        <p><i><b>Result:</b> Modern teams prefer DVCS for speed, reliability, and freedom from single points of failure</i></p>
